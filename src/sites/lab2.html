            <div class="project_text"> Lab<sup>2</sup> presents an experimental approach to a team building exercise
                specifically geared to train virtual, i.e. non-face-to-face, collaboration:
                <ul>
                    <li class="list"><strong> Bonding game framing: </strong> The game-based exercise engages two
                        players in a playful, fun activity which aims to foster social bonds. The game principle of
                        Lab<sup>2</sup> is based on the board game The Amazing Labyrinth&reg; (Kobbert, Ravensburger,
                        1968) which invites players to a treasure hunt in a movable maze.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list"><strong> Collaborative gameplay: </strong> The gameplay design aims at triggering
                        as much of collaborative communication between the players as possible. However, they rely on
                        verbal communication only and cannot see each other’s interface. For winning the game the
                        players have to work together.
                    </li>
                    <li class="list"><strong> Cross-reality interfaces: </strong> For mimicking the interdisciplinary
                        collaboration common in virtual teams, the two players take asymmetrical roles. They use each an
                        individual interface that provides them with a role-specific set of game controls and view of
                        the maze.
                        The interfaces were designed towards maximum intuitivity in order to not unnecessarily obstruct
                        the players when playing the game. In achieving this, one interface employs real-world tangibles
                        (a game board with movable tiles), the other immersive virtual reality (through a head-mounted
                        display). The two interfaces are cross-linked in real time.

            <div class="project_text"> The players take the roles of two computer scientists who have been locked up in
                their lab by a malicious AI they have been experimenting on. The only way to free themselves is to
                retrieve and run the AI's "Emergency Shutdown Programme". However, the programme's five code fragments
                are hidden inside the AI’s maze of registers. In taking on the challenge, the computer scientists have
                managed to cobble together two interfaces that allow them to access the AI to recover the code.
                <div class="project_paragraph"> Through their individual interfaces the players take on asymmetric
                    roles: one player uses an HMD to find himself inside the AI's maze of registers (the 3D maze) where
                    he has to search for the code fragments. The other player uses the physical game board to re-arrange
                    the AI's hardware (the game board maze) in order to create pathways to the code fragments. He then
                    directs the VR-player towards them. While playing the game, the players cannot see each other but
                    rely on verbal communication only.
                </div>
                <div class="project_paragraph"> Once at a code container, the VR-player can read the necessary
                    information (a number) on its label that the players require for unlocking and downloading the code
                    fragment. The unlocking process involves a joint task that the players have to perform
                    simultaneously.
                </div>
                <div class="project_paragraph"> However, the players will also need to be on the alert at all times as
                    the AI will try to fend off the invaders.
                    Each player has limited health resources and an uncareful action might draw on these. If one player
                    runs out of resources, the game is lost for both. Hence, the players sink and swim together.
